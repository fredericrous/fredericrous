- ðŸŒ± I've started the functional programming journey, I'm trying to use monads like Either and IO every time I get a chance :P 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Javascript or Development Lifecycle, or let's start an endless conversation about the weather

- âš¡ Fun fact: Back in 2002, I used to stay up late reading novels or playing Game Boy Advance just to make sure my FTP transfers would complete with success. Some of the websites I worked on at the time are till online, check out http://jk2mp.free.fr/
